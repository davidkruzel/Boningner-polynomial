# Boningner-polynomial

This program calculates Boninger's nu polynomials for single-component knots, as described in his paper "The Jones Polynomial From a Goeritz Matrix."

The program expects a Gauss code as an input. For example, "u1-,o2+,u3-,o1-,u4+,o3-,u2+,o4+" is a valid input. o/u denotes an over/under crossing, and +/- denotes the sign of the crossing. For a more specific description of this notation, see section 3.2 of Kauffman's paper "Virtual Knot Theory."
